FOR THE PENGUIN DATASET :
1) Both Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression give same accuracy on training and test datasets.
2) Both Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression have same Area Under ROC curve. They distinguish between the penguins classes everytime as we can observe from the results above.
3) The gain curve reaches 100% by the last decile, and the lift curve starts high in the top deciles and gradually declines, indicating that the model performs well for the top-ranked predictions but diminishes in performance as it processes less likely predictions.
4) For this dataset they perform equally well. there is not much to distinguish as it is very samll dataset.

ERROR :
* I was unable to load the MNIST dataset directly 
i) using fetch_openml library there was an error :: ## URLError: <urlopen error [Errno 23] Host is unreachable> ## 
ii)I tried using tensorflow but then I got value error :: ## ValueError: Can't find a pure Python 3 wheel for 'tensorflow'.
See: https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/faq.html#why-can-t-micropip-find-a-pure-python-wheel-for-a-package
You can use `await micropip.install(..., keep_going=True)` to get a list of all packages with missing wheels.##

I could not work it out and play around with this error as I am using Library's computer but will try to do it once I get mine back from repair.
So what I did is I used a MNIST CSV file , very small test file I got from Github [1]. 

FOR THE MNIST DATASET :
1) For Naive Bayes Approach I got accuracy of 55% and for Logistic Regression I got 91%.
2) For this dataset NB approach performed very poor compared to LR approach, This happened because of the large dataset type and more classes.

CONCLUSION FROM THE ABOVE OBSERVATION : 
Logistic Regression works better for large as well as small dataset and Naive Bayes works good only with smaller dataset. 
LR approach has an edge over NB approach.
